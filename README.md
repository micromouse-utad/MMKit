# Micromouse Kit library 

The MMkit is a library that provides an object-oriented interfacefor the [MicroMouse Kit Robot](https://www.micromouse.utad.pt/?page_id=998&lang=en), as well as some examples to help you start to program the MMKit. \
Some of this examples are: 

Basic: 
- MoveFoward
- TurnLeft
- TurnRight
- TesteIRSensors 

Advanced: 
- FloodFillAlgorithm
- RandomNextMove
- RightWallFollow

## The Kit
